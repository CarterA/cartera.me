			<h1><a href="http://opt-6.com/">Opt-6 Products, LLC</a></h1>
		</header>
		<p>Opt-6 Products is a small software company that I founded in February of 2009. It specializes in Mac and iOS development, with two excellent iOS apps and one small Mac utility currently available. I am the lead developer at Opt-6, though I work with three other excellent developers: <a href="http://georgews.com/">George Woodliff-Stanley</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mathcolo">Preston M.</a>, and <a href="http://gnomepi.com/">Zach Fisher</a>. I also work with one particularly talented graphic designer, <a href="http://wilnichols.com/">Wil Nichols</a>.</p>

		<p>CZKit is a collection of open-source libraries of Objective-C code, written entirely by myself. It includes a library of categories that extend existing Apple classes, a library of utility classes for random functions, a library of custom UI elements, and a library of custom views. It also includes a set of Xcode project/file templates.</p>

		<p>Five Square is a completely new solitaire card game of strategy and skill. It combines the simplicity and elegance of a classic solitaire game with the challenge of complex strategic play. I assisted <a href="http://georgews.com/">George Woodliff-Stanley</a> in the development of Five Square, while the lovely graphics were created by <a href="http://wilnichols.com/">Wil Nichols</a>.</p>
