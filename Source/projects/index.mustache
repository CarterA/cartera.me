			<h1><a href="http://opt-6.com/">Opt-6 Products, LLC</a></h1>
		</header>
		<p>Opt-6 Products is a small software company that I founded in February of 2009. It specializes in Mac and iOS development, with two excellent iOS apps and one small Mac utility currently available. I am the lead developer at Opt-6, and I work with three other excellent developers: <a href="http://georgews.com/">George Woodliff-Stanley</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mathcolo">Preston M.</a>, and <a href="http://gnomepi.com/">Zach Fisher</a>. I also work with one incredibly talented graphic designer, <a href="http://wilnichols.com/">Wil Nichols</a>.</p>

		<p>Tribo is the open-source blogging engine that powers this site. The app is written in Objective-C, includes a native Mac interface, and is blazingly fast. It produces a static set of files that can be served by any self-respecting web server, so the sites it creates are eminently portable.</p>

		<p>Five Square is a completely new solitaire card game of strategy and skill. It combines the simplicity and elegance of a classic solitaire game with the challenge of complex strategic play. I co-developed Five Square with <a href="http://georgews.com/">George Woodliff-Stanley</a>, while the lovely graphics were created by <a href="http://wilnichols.com/">Wil Nichols</a>.</p>
