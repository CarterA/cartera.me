# When I Grow Up #  

An astronaut. That's the first one I can remember. If not that, I'm sure it was something just as cliché (fireman? policeman?). Yes, the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?" is so commonplace now that we just laugh it off as a social standard. And I did, for a while. For the majority of my life I've given vague answers. *Some sort of scientist*, *someone that works with computers*, or something else noncommittal. This was an attempt to cover up the fact that I had no idea *what* I wanted to be when I grew up.  

I still don't! And surprise, surprise, the years keep ticking by. I'll be applying to colleges soon, and I can already tell you what I hate the most: majors. The idea that the system our century-old university employs forces me to limit myself to one particular set of knowledge is preposterous. But it's accepted. And it is, in many ways, just a continuation of that damn question, "what do you want to be when you grow up?"

Dammit, I want to be good. I want to do something I like, and I want to make the lives of others better. I want to change things. I want to spend my entire life learning, because I can't think of a better way to spend it. I want to spend as much time as I can with my family and my friends, because once again, I can't think of better people to surround myself with.  

Or you know, I could be a computer programmer.  

Don't get me wrong, I love programming. It makes my mind stretch and contort into positions I can't imagine, and the method of thinking it taught me has helped me through countless other endeavors. I am a better problem solver because of programming. It will undoubtedly be a good way for me to start my life strong. But do I want to be a programmer "when I grow up"? No. No, I don't.  

The idea that we use "to be" to describe profession is exactly my problem with this system. I am happy to *work* as a programmer, but must I *be* one? I'd much rather *be* friendly. *Be* kind. *Be* significant.  

That last one - significant. That is a trait that is very difficult to come by, and especially difficult while maintaining other positive traits. As I said before, I want to change things. Yes, that's cliché, but it's true. Being skilled as a programmer will hopefully aid me in reaching that goal, but it's almost definitely not going to get me there all on its own.  

So what do I pick as my major? Do I choose the skill that I know I already grasp, and build on that? Or do I reach out and choose another science that interests me, and hope it proves useful in reaching that lofty goal?  

I'm leaning toward choosing none-of-the-above on this particular question. I'd like to attend college, but not for the purpose of building a skill for later use. I'd like to attend college for the sake of learning itself. I want to learn as much as I possibly can. And hopefully, a side effect of that knowledge will be the will to go on and change the world.
