		<p>Most people have heard that the iTunes Music Store is raising prices on a ton of songs. People are quite pissed at the 30 cent increase in price. I don&#39;t get it. Since when were people entitled to 99 cent songs? Have you ever tried to buy a real CD? It&#39;s not like that happens in a record store. And people dislike the variations in the pricing. When you go to a record store, is the brand new release of the popular band more expensive than the month-old releases by the B-rated band? Yep. this is just bringing more complexity to a market that wasn&#39;t working perfectly. And the artists get more money which is good.  </p>

<p>Also, something to consider is the lack of song DRM. Even in my small circle of friends, I&#39;m already seeing more sharing of music. I&#39;m against this at a large scale, and it bugs me. In essence, iTunes has to account for the fact that every purchased copy of the music may very well end up on 5-10 computers, or more if it gets put up on a torrent. Even if you don&#39;t pirate music, we all have to pay for them. It&#39;s not fair, but it is the only way the artists are going to get fed. And we like our artists well-nourished.  </p>

<p>So my overall opinion: suck it up. The economic collapse is affecting everyone, the artists need to eat, and piracy of music is rampant. 30 cents per song isn&#39;t that much, deal with it.  </p>

<p>Added note: As a reader pointed out to me, this is all only the case if more of the revenue from higher priced songs goes to the artists. I&#39;ve searched for a while now and can&#39;t find the actual figures for artist compensation when songs are bought on iTunes. If someone could comment about this, I&#39;d be much obliged.</p>
