		<p>A few days ago, my brother woke me up. I was very intent on telling him that I had solved his code error: he had forgotten a semicolon. Now, a bit of background here. My brother doesn&#39;t program. He never has, and never will. Also, the easiest error to make when programming in Objective-C (which I do) is to forget to append every line with a semicolon. Thus, I probably meant to make him feel dumb about his amateur coding mistake: if he had actually made it.</p>

<p>He met my odd comment with absolute confusion. A few moments after he didn&#39;t instantly understand what I meant, I realized that there was something strange going on. I then tried to think back to <em>why</em> I had told him this in the first place: and I couldn&#39;t come up with the reason. Thus, the trigger for my strange actions must have stemmed from a dream. A dream about code.</p>

<p>This, my friends, is a whole new level of obsession. Of all the things I&#39;ve ever done relating to programming, this takes the cake. I&#39;ve stayed up past 3AM trying to solve an exception, and I&#39;ve actually pulled hair out of my head looking at a frozen application, but never before have I <em>dreamt</em> about code. It surprises even me, and my middle name is OCD.</p>

<p>I suppose the reasoning behind this is probably the fact that I haven&#39;t been able to get the xMod table view working properly yet. But that is definitely <em>not</em> a simple error to fix...unless my subconscious knows more about NSCells than I do.</p>
