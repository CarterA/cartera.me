		<p>Restroom etiquette is an important topic to cover, and should be treated as such. My parents never taught me much about the complexities that can be found when in a public restroom, and I thought that sharing my own experiences and discoveries might benefit some of you less-experienced people out there. I&#39;ve divided this post into two sections, one for those of you who use restrooms, and one for the rare person that plans&#47;constructs restrooms. Keep in mind that all of this is written from the perspective of a man, so women&#39;s restrooms may not fit into these rules. Enjoy.  </p>

<h2>Restroom Users</h2>

<p>To the people who use the restroom in groups:  Don&#39;t talk to each other. I get that you may have been having a conversation as you entered the restroom, but it&#39;s awkward and annoying to have to listen to someone else&#39;s conversations while relieving yourself. I can&#39;t imagine that it would be very difficult for you to simply pause your conversation until you left the room.  </p>

<p>To those of you who are too cool to wash your hands:  You just touched something that I don&#39;t want to know about, let alone come in second-hand contact with in a few moments. You are about to touch the sink, the paper towel dispenser, and the door handle. It doesn&#39;t take that long, so please just wash your hands. As a side note for this rule, I&#39;d like to commit to something:  if I see you fail to wash your hands, and then touch me or anything others may touch, I will personally dunk your hands in gasoline and light them on fire. Thanks!  </p>

<p>To old men and eager children:  Don&#39;t make noises when you&#39;re relieving yourself. The last thing I ever want to hear is a large sigh coming from the urinal next to me. It&#39;s disgusting, unnerving, and just plain rude. I know you can avoid it, so just don&#39;t do it.  </p>

<p>To anxious people that only care about themselves:  If a stall&#47;door is locked, don&#39;t knock. This is very simple. If the door won&#39;t open, there&#39;s a reason for that. Knocking only communicates to the person inside the following message:  <em>&quot;Hey! You know, I&#39;m out here...and you should hurry up!&quot;</em> In other words, it&#39;s just rude. By trying to open the door and realizing it&#39;s locked, you&#39;ve already let me know that you&#39;re there. Knocking just proves that you&#39;re there, and you&#39;re a douchebag.  </p>

<h2>Restroom Planners</h2>

<p>First and foremost (only relevant to men):  Put dividers between the urinals. I cannot imagine that skimping out on that can save you that much cash. I can&#39;t tell you how uncomfortable it makes me feel to know that another man can look to the left or right and see...well, you know. It&#39;s just disturbing.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to request that you include paper towels. I get that sometimes air driers make some amount of sense, but there are times when they just piss me off. Why don&#39;t you just include both? Then the people with nothing better to do can sit around and wait for their hands to dry, and I can be out the door and back to my life quicker.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s all for now, but I&#39;ll probably add more as my frustration gets worse.  </p>
