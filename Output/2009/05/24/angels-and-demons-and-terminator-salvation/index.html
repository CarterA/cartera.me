		<p>Haven&#39;t reviewed any movies recently, though I would talk about the two I&#39;ve seen in the past week.  </p>

<h2>Angels and Demons</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed this movie. The book is one of my all-time favorite reads, and I&#39;m happy with the movie&#39;s representation of it. It can&#39;t really live up to it at all, but it did its best. The action sequences were well-choreographedand exciting, and the acting was solid. The plot was a bit difficult to follow, probably due to the amount of characters and elements that were cut out from the book. Overall, it is a movie I would recommend to most people.  </p>

<h2>Terminator Salvation</h2>

<p>The plot for this movie was really difficult to follow, of course, I haven&#39;t seen any of the other movies. That is probably why. But apart from that, the action sequences were intense and well-done. The pyrotechnics were elaborate, and sometimes excessive, yet I still enjoyed them. I have to say, I cracked up when the terminator&#47;person thing was in the computer room, and the screen said &quot;Sync Complete.&quot; I half expected it to start verifying. Ah well. Overall, good only for the action. Nothing else really of value in it.</p>
