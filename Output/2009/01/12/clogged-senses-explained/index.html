		<p>My last post, &quot;Clogged Senses,&quot; confused a lot of people, including myself. It was late at night and my mind was a bit out of whack. Yet, when I read it again, it still all makes perfect sense to me. The key is understanding all the pieces of the analogy.  </p>

<p>Begin with the setting, a depressing city scene. No interesting features, plenty of distractions. Now see my school, where nothing is really interesting me and everything I see and interact with feels like it&#39;s just bringing me further from my goals.  </p>

<p>Skyscrapers bearing down on you. Sounds a bit like those goddawful teachers&#47;adults that are always watching everything you do. Waiting for you to make even a small mistake.  </p>

<p>1000s of cars, racing around you. Other people&#39;s lives you never get to touch, or if you do, barely get to affect. You may occasionally connect with someone else, but if you do, it&#39;s fleeting.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s more to this then just that, but I&#39;m not even sure what it all means. This is taken directly from a recurring nightmare I&#39;ve been having for years. Any insights or ideas, comment.  </p>
