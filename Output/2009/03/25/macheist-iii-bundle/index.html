		<p>...sucks. I swear to god, if shareware mac devs don&#39;t start hiring UI&#47;icon designers, I&#39;m going to pay for them myself.  </p>

<p>These are my tentative thoughts on each app that has been unlocked. I&#39;ll be posting more on each app later.  </p>

<p>iSale:  I already have GarageSale, which is OK. I honestly never really sell anything on eBay, but w&#47;e. The UI for this one is awkward at best, and ugly at it&#39;s usual.  </p>

<p>Picturesque:  Neat idea. I already have Photoshop, PixelMator, DrawIt, GIMP, and countless other image editors. The UI of this one is in the &quot;failed attempt at delicious&quot; category.  </p>

<p>SousChef:  I&#39;m not a cook.  </p>

<p>World of Goo:  I&#39;m not a gamer.  </p>

<p>PhoneView:  SSH. I have a JailBroken phone (and I&#39;m proud!), so this doesn&#39;t really add anything for me. Anyways, not the best UI (in fact, it sucks), and I prefer hacking my way into the iPhone&#39;s filesystem anyway.  </p>

<p>LittleSnapper:  Not bad. I have tried it before. Just never fell in love, due to my adoration for the simplicity of GrabUp. Both services have one fatal flaw:  URL length. They both generate gigantic URLs that are ugly in AIM chats, and impossible to caption in tweets. Probably will never find a place in my workflow, considering Pasta will be fixing this one flaw anyway.  </p>

<p>Acorn:  See:  Picturesque.  </p>

<p>Kinemac:  My eyes are bleeding. Bleeding. The UI for this is the worst I&#39;ve ever had the displeasure of seeing. I can&#39;t use it, even if I had a use for it. I would PAY them, just to uncheck the &quot;Drop Shadow&quot; box in the Blending Options window.  </p>

<p>As I said, there is more to write about these, but it is time for me to relax. I&#39;ll be testing all of them (except for Kinemac. I cannot even look at it), and reviewing each one. Oh, and yes, I did buy it. If anyone wants a license to Kinemac, comment. I&#39;ll give it to you. Hell, I&#39;ll pay you to take it from me.</p>
