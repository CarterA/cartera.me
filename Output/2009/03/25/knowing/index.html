		<p>I saw the movie &quot;Knowing&quot; today, and I&#39;m sorry that I did. It was the worst movie I&#39;ve seen in a long time.  </p>

<p>The basic principle seems pretty intriguing. The idea is that a list of numbers from a time capsule that was buried 50 years ago has somehow predicted every major disaster since the time it was written. And there are 3 more to go, until the numbers run out. Nicolas Cage is first narrowly missed by a plane crash, which really doesn&#39;t faze him at all. Why? Terrible directing. He then saves a baby and it&#39;s mother by jumping on top of them, right as two subways collide in a busy station. I&#39;ll admit, those two scenes were amazingly cool. But it went downhill from there. There was some sort of surreal, alien-ish aspect of the whole thing, that seemed to be the writer&#39;s at a loss for a way out of the situation. Here, I have an idea:  have a few people die. It&#39;s already a scary movie, it doesn&#39;t have to end with children frolicking in a field of poorly-animated wheat. I&#39;m not kidding there, that&#39;s actually the ending.  </p>

<p>Aliens are a writer&#39;s ace-up-the-sleeve. But that&#39;s cheating. Seriously, it ruins the film. For more proof, check the last Indiana Jones film, and this one. I&#39;m sorry, but the children flying away in a glowing space ship is not a good ending. Were the aliens ever mentioned beforehand? Yep. They&#39;re called the &quot;Whisper People.&quot; The moment the little girl said that name, I totally cracked up. I&#39;m sorry, but the movie jumped the shark right there.  </p>

<p>The acting was terrible. I am usually fine with Nicolas Cage, but he was directed really poorly in this film. He never did anything. And his character didn&#39;t develop in the slightest. And the two children were absolutely awful. I&#39;m going to steal from my brother&#39;s commentary here...the little kid will do really well in the bio-pic for Keanu Reeves. No feeling, no talent. Cool!  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t see this movie. You&#39;ll never get those 2 hours back. Seriously, don&#39;t lose the time. I recommend Frost&#47;Nixon, Slumdog Millionaire, and recently, Duplicity.</p>
