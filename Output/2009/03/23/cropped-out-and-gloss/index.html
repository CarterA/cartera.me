		<p>I know, the two topics have nothing to do with each other. And no, I&#39;m not referring to the infamous MTF member Gloss, I&#39;m referring to the &quot;artistic&quot; style of many icons nowadays.  </p>

<h2>Cropped Out</h2>

<p>In short, it&#39;s a new website. You can see the work in progress as I make changes slowly at http:&#47;&#47;www.croppedout.com&#47;wp&#47; . It&#39;s a gallery and store for a friend of mine, Hannah Cohen. She&#39;s an incredible photographer, and she needed a site that reflected that. And yes, this is totally a shameless plug for the site. The store section isn&#39;t even close to being done, and if anybody knows of any free, and extensible PHP-based shopping cart frameworks, that are compatible with PayPal, please let me know. Until it&#39;s done, just enjoy the amazing pictures, and feel free to compliment me on the site (I know, it&#39;s totally incredible), or Hannah on the pictures.  </p>

<h2>Gloss</h2>

<p>If you know me very well, you&#39;ll know I have a personal vendetta against glossy icons and UI elements. I hate them. I hate everything about them. Real objects in the world don&#39;t do that, unless they&#39;re made out of glass or plastic. And my iPhone icons are not made of either. Seriously, just look at them. Leopard was a step in the right direction. I love the inset style of the text on the window titlebars, and the menubar icons. I love the silver capsule-style buttons in the toolbars. But the &quot;traffic lights&quot; are obnoxious and obscene. And then make the window asymmetrical, which also bugs me a lot.  </p>

<p>Matte style icons make so much more sense. Keep in mind the difference between gloss and shine. Metal shines. Glass is glossy. Huge difference. Oh well, rant over.</p>
