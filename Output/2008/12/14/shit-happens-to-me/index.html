		<p>How did this happen?  </p>

<p>What went wrong? What could I have done? Why does shit like this always happen to me?  </p>

<p>As you probably figured out, I&#39;m just a tad bit depressed. Actually, very depressed. I had been dating her for 5 months...I thought it was going so well. I really had&#47;have feelings for her. But she&#39;s lost interest. She&#39;s moved on. Maybe for the best. People really are best left without me, I guess. I cause sadness, depression, and anything else that&#39;s horrible. I&#39;m a bad influence, and a horrible friend. And now, I clearly was a horrible boyfriend. </p>

<p>Anything I touch (figuratively) goes to hell. My software went well until I tried to make it better. Now it&#39;s a pain in the ass, and unsuccessful to boot. Half my friends can&#39;t actually stand me, and the girl I thought I really had a connection with didn&#39;t share the feeling.  </p>

<p>Damnit, I&#39;m still being depressing.</p>
