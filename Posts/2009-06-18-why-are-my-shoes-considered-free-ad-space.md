# Why are my shoes considered free ad space? #

In general, unless you're buying designer clothes, the brand of a piece of clothing is fairly subtly added to your clothes. This is advertising, but it isn't extremely obvious or obnoxious. This of course changes when you buy designer clothes, but I'm not a poser: so that doesn't really apply to me.  

Despite this general rule, even the cheapest, most basic pair of Nike sneakers have the Nike logo and name plastered across almost every inch of the shoe. Why are shoes exempt from the "no obvious branding on clothing" rule? No clue. But I for one would rather not be walking around on a pair of billboards.
