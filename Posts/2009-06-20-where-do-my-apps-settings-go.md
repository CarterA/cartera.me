# Where do my app's settings go? #

I can't decide. Showoff needs preferences in it, but I am getting two totally different opinions on where iPhone app settings should be placed. Do they get stuck inside Settings.app, or do I add yet another button to my app and put them in the app itself? Opinions, anyone?
