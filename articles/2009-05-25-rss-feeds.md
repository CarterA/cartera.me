Hey all, just a quick bit of blog-related news for you. I changed the RSS settings for the blog so that it is now using Feedburner. This allows me to get stats about how many people read my blog consistently, what posts are more popular, etc. This means that if you subscribe to the old RSS feed, you should move to the new one. The links on the site are updated for the new feed, but for you lazy folk, here is a direct link:

Enjoy!
