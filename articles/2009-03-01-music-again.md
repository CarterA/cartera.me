A while back I did a quick post about music. Here goes another one...  

Currently I'm listening to "Absolute" by The Fray. Yes, I like The Fray. Deal with it.  

Seether has a new single out, "Careless Whisper." It's a cover of an older song, but their cover is absolutely bitchin. Listen to it, right now.  

Papa Roach, my favorite band, is releasing a new album in less than a month. They've released two singles so far, Hollywood Whore and Lifeline. Lifeline isn't great, but it's okay. Hollywood Whore, as I said in my previous music post, is amazingly awesome. You should listen to it. Now.  

Enjoy my suggestions!
