title: Carbon Offsets

I was reading through a thread in a forum online, and someone was mentioning carbon offsets. I haven't ever really researched them, but they always sounded like a great concept to me.  

Someone on this forum then pointed out that years ago, the Catholic church would sell "indulgences" to rich folk. Basically, they were selling the ability for someone to sin without punishment or guilt.  

My question to all of you is, are these two systems the same? Are we buying the ability to be guilt-free?
