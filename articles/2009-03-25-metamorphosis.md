Papa Roach released their new album. I am in love.  

It is just what I need. More music. Okay, admittedly, I am full of new music already. But still, this is enough to hold me over until...well, I don't know. Seether might be working on a new album, so that might come in time.  

Best songs in the album are Change or Die, Hollywood Whore, and I Almost Told You That I Loved You. Don't go for more then 10 minutes after reading this before listening to them.
