title: Cropped Out, and Gloss

I know, the two topics have nothing to do with each other. And no, I'm not referring to the infamous MTF member Gloss, I'm referring to the "artistic" style of many icons nowadays.  

## Cropped Out ##

In short, it's a new website. You can see the work in progress as I make changes slowly at http://www.croppedout.com/wp/ . It's a gallery and store for a friend of mine, Hannah Cohen. She's an incredible photographer, and she needed a site that reflected that. And yes, this is totally a shameless plug for the site. The store section isn't even close to being done, and if anybody knows of any free, and extensible PHP-based shopping cart frameworks, that are compatible with PayPal, please let me know. Until it's done, just enjoy the amazing pictures, and feel free to compliment me on the site (I know, it's totally incredible), or Hannah on the pictures.  

## Gloss ##

If you know me very well, you'll know I have a personal vendetta against glossy icons and UI elements. I hate them. I hate everything about them. Real objects in the world don't do that, unless they're made out of glass or plastic. And my iPhone icons are not made of either. Seriously, just look at them. Leopard was a step in the right direction. I love the inset style of the text on the window titlebars, and the menubar icons. I love the silver capsule-style buttons in the toolbars. But the "traffic lights" are obnoxious and obscene. And then make the window asymmetrical, which also bugs me a lot.  

Matte style icons make so much more sense. Keep in mind the difference between gloss and shine. Metal shines. Glass is glossy. Huge difference. Oh well, rant over.
