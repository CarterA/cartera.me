Geeky post time!  

The Safari 4 public beta is out! It's been met with mixed feelings from me...  

The appearance is overall, crappy and overdone. Top sites is a good idea (not by Apple's part though, it's in every other browser, in some way) but the 3D effect is just cheesy and dumb. The progress bar died, and I really liked the old one. It's been replaced by a throbber, which doesn't really display progress at all. Thanks apple! The address bar is unified with a dumbass plus button, which is just plain terrible looking. I honestly don't bookmark that much, and if I did, I'd use a keyboard shortcut. And the refresh button needs to come back to it's usual place, please.  

And finally, the tabs. Oh. My. God. I get that they are copying Chrome because it's a hit, but that is NOT the part people like. Chrome works well in every way, except appearance! So go ahead, get it's speed, but do NOT get it's look. Thus, I instantly found and used this hidden preference (enter into Terminal.app and hit return):  
    defaults write com.apple.Safari DebugSafari4TabBarIsOnTop false  
Okay, well, those are my criticisms. Other than those, it's pretty great. Blazing fast, and it aces the Acid3 test (acid3.acidtests.org). I'll keep it, as long as the tab bar preference stays.
