Alright, well Opt-6's pride and joy, first-born payware appstore app, reason that I wake up in the morning, Five Square has been rejected by Apple for the use of the "Reply" button in the context of "Undo". I get that it is a valid reason, but this is where we just need to have them send us an email and have us fix it in an update.
